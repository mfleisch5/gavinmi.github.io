	<p>Northeastern students need a simple way to track the progress we’ve made towards our degrees. In order to keep track of classes we’ve taken and those that still need to be completed, it is imperative that we have a user-friendly system which shows the degree requirements that need to be met and plans our overall school schedule. Right now, the system in place to do this is less than satisfactory. The myNEU degree audit displays the necessary information, but in a way that is unclear and hard to read. Our class requirements are shown in a long list, with unclear characters giving us confusing information about classes, and it is annoying to scroll all the way through to see what classes we need next. This project will help users by addressing the many problems with the current system, providing a clear way to track progress. It will condense all necessary information so that users can see at a quick glance which classes they have left to complete, and will provide all the information that is relevant to them. </p>

	<p>The clear-cut target user of our audit interface is Northeastern students. If we dive deeper, the principal audience for the program is Northeastern students who are dissatisfied with their counselors and online resources, and need a straightforward and user-friendly way to find out which classes they need to take. Freshman students mostly come from schools that guide them in the process of class selection. They are unaccustomed to the independence that counselors give them, and the audit should be a way to aid them in an intimidating process. Currently, these students are being let down by the support myNEU is supposed to provide. Our project will assist these students in an effective way. </p>

	<p>Our solution is a website that brings together all the information that a student might need to track and plan their degree into one place. The main page would be an overview page with a progress bar and general information about their degree requirements. There would be a bar at the top with a few other tabs. One of them would be a more specific progress tab, which would show a full list of requirements and classes left. It would show things like credit requirements and full information about classes. Another tab would be the class suggestion tab, which would look at the requirements that student needs and offer suggestions for what classes they can take next. The student could select classes and keep track of them. The final tab would show a complete schedule for the entirety of the student’s career. It would allow them to put in classes, co-op, and breaks so they can have an idea of what their college schedule will look like. Throughout the site, information will be presented to the user in a clear way that shows exactly what they need to know. Symbols with a clear meaning will be used, like a red X to indicate incomplete requirements, with a green check representing complete ones. When classes are mentioned, it will be possible to hover over them to get information about that class. As students, we know what sort of things we would want to know, and so we can show this information in a way that makes sense. We’ll also be striving to provide students the ability to switch between profiles, so they can check what their plan might look like if they changed degrees or if they just want to try out alternative schedules, although that is more of a plus than a must in terms of implementation requirements as of yet. Our system should hopefully provide all the information in a way that makes sense to the students who use it and overall provide a much better system to track degree progress. </p>
