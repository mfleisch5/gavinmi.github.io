		<h1>Welcome to DA+</h1>
		<h3>Startup Instructions</h3>
		<p>Click on the handy little button down below to launch our initial version of the website. It will take you to our homepage, where you can navigate around and complete our tasks! Make sure you're on Chrome, Safari, Opera, or Firefox.</p>
		<h3>Briefing</h3>
		<p>Hey there! We’re in the process of designing an improved and user-friendly degree auditor for Northeastern students. It’ll be much more efficient and quick to find the classes you need to take to fulfill your credit requirements. We were hoping that you could help us better our design by testing out our prototype.</p>

		<p><b>Prefacing Consent:</b> We will not publish your name in any of the measures we conduct. This is for our class, and your participation is completely up to you. This study should take at the very most 15 minutes. Thank you so much for helping us with this!</p>

		<p><b>Background:</b> Our goal is to create an entirely new degree auditor for students, primarily because the current system we have on MyNEU is difficult to navigate and unnecessarily complex. We want you to test whether our design is actually efficient and easy to navigate before we start coding the actual web application. We’ve created a test version that we will use to base our system off of, and we have designed specific tasks that represent how we think Northeastern students will use our system.</p>

		<p>Your job is to explore our designs like you would any website. The conductor of the test will be with you to measure and record your responses, but he or she will not be able to answer your questions. We want to know about the worst parts of our design. Please speak up about anything that can be improved and anything you find confusing about the interface. Even though we can’t answer you, if you have questions please raise them so we can jot them down. Thank you so much again for participating, and if you are confused about anything in this briefing, let the conductor know and he or she will be glad to fill you in. Have fun!
		</p>
